## 🎯 How to Use These Documents

### 1. **DEVELOPMENT_INDEX.md** (Primary Reference)
- **Purpose**: Master checklist and progress tracker
- **Usage**: 
  - Check off completed tasks with [x]
  - Add notes under each section
  - Update performance metrics
  - Document decisions and blockers
- **Update Frequency**: After every task completion

### 2. **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** (Daily Dashboard)
- **Purpose**: Current sprint focus and daily tasks
- **Usage**:
  - Update "Today's Tasks" each morning
  - Track "In Progress" items
  - Note blockers immediately
  - Update progress bars
- **Update Frequency**: Start and end of each day

### 3. **TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md** (Technical Reference)
- **Purpose**: System design and technical specifications
- **Usage**:
  - Reference for implementation details
  - Update with architectural decisions
  - Document performance benchmarks
- **Update Frequency**: When architecture changes

### 4. **CHANGELOG.md** (Version History)
- **Purpose**: Track all changes and releases
- **Usage**:
  - Add entry for each significant change
  - Follow semantic versioning
  - Document breaking changes
- **Update Frequency**: With each commit/feature

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Step 1: Review the Plan
1. Read through `DEVELOPMENT_INDEX.md` completely
2. Understand the 8-phase development plan
3. Note the target specifications

### Step 2: Set Up Development Environment
1. Follow Phase 1 checklist in `DEVELOPMENT_INDEX.md`
2. Check off completed items
3. Add notes about any issues

### Step 3: Begin Implementation
1. Start with Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
2. Update progress in both:
   - `DEVELOPMENT_INDEX.md` (detailed progress)
   - `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (daily updates)

## 📝 Important Notes for Development

### Code Implementation Order
1. **Do NOT write code until**:
   - Project structure is created
   - Dependencies are listed
   - Database schema is designed
   - API endpoints are documented

2. **Follow the phases strictly**:
   - Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - Test thoroughly at each phase
   - Document as you go

### Documentation Updates
When implementing any feature:
1. ✅ Check off the task in `DEVELOPMENT_INDEX.md`
2. 📝 Add implementation notes
3. 🔧 Update technical specs if needed
4. 📊 Record performance metrics
5. 🐛 Log any issues found

### Key Reminders
- **Minimal Setup Goal**: Users should only need to enter keyword + location
- **Anti-Detection Priority**: Stealth is crucial for success
- **Quality Over Speed**: Better to have reliable extraction than fast but blocked
- **Test Everything**: Each component should have tests

## 🎪 Current Status

**Project Phase**: Planning Complete ✅  
**Next Phase**: Core Infrastructure Setup  
**Start Date**: 2025-07-04  
**Target Completion**: 9 weeks  

## 🔄 Update Protocol

Every development session should:
1. **START**: Update `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` with today's goals
2. **DURING**: Check off tasks in `DEVELOPMENT_INDEX.md`
3. **END**: 
   - Update progress percentages
   - Note blockers
   - Plan next session
   - Commit documentation changes

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use the checklists**: They're there to ensure nothing is missed
2. **Document decisions**: Future you will thank present you
3. **Test early**: Don't wait until Phase 7 to start testing
4. **Keep it simple**: Minimal setup is a core requirement
5. **Ask questions**: If something isn't clear in the docs, clarify it
